#  Welcome to RTOnline-Revive

(The name is probably inspired by TFOR)

This org is meant to recreate part of the core gameplay of a long dead chinese competitive FPS gamed called `RTOnline`. All the code were directly unpacked from the package files taken directly from the game. We can make changes to the game by editing the source code and recompiling.
